# DFCOMPS 1v1 server

Server is designed to host 1v1 matches, do the matchmaking, pickbans and send result to dfcomps backend.
Backend interaction is done via secret key, so it is the only thing which can not be tested after cloning repo.

# Starting instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/deniskond/dfcomps.ru-frontend.git
cd 1v1-server
npm install
npm start
```
